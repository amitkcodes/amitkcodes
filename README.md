Projects
NTP Server Monitoring Script

Description: A Python-based tool monitoring 16+ NTP servers (e.g., samay1.nic.in, 157.20.66.8) for time synchronization. Logs offsets to CSV, sends email alerts after 3 consecutive failures or high offsets (>0.01s), and supports rate-limiting and log rotation. Deployed in Docker for portability.
Technologies: Python, ntplib, threading, logging, Docker, CSV
Features:
Configurable monitoring intervals and server list.
Robust alerting with rate-limiting to avoid spam.
Containerized deployment for scalability.


Achievements: Collaborated with #Team NPL (Divya Singh Yadav, Dr. Deepak Sharma, Dr. Ashish Agrawal, Dr. Subhasis Panja) to ensure precise synchronization.
Repository: github.com/amitkcodes/ntp-monitoring (update with actual link)
Demo: amitkcodes.github.io/ntp-demo (add demo if available)
 (add after setting up workflow)

Flask Alert System

Description: A Flask REST API for real-time email and WhatsApp alerts to multiple recipients, integrated with Gmail SMTP and Twilio WhatsApp API. Features dynamic recipient lists and robust error handling (e.g., SMTP timeouts, JSON parsing errors).
Technologies: Python, Flask, smtplib, twilio, REST API, JSON
Features:
Handles multiple recipients via POST requests.
Tested with cURL and VS Code for reliability.
Extensible for SMS or other channels.


Achievements: Streamlined alert delivery for time-sensitive applications.

[Add Your Project, e.g., CI/CD Pipeline]

Description: [e.g., Automated CI/CD pipeline for a web app, deploying to AWS ECS with Jenkins and Docker] FiftyOne is an open-source tool for building high-quality datasets and computer vision models, offering visualization, evaluation, and debugging capabilities for machine learning workflows.
Technologies: [e.g., Jenkins, Docker, AWS ECS, Terraform]
Features: [e.g., Automated testing, containerized deployment, rollback support]
Repository: github.com/amitkcodes/cicd-project (create and link)
Demo: amitkcodes.github.io/cicd-demo (add demo if available)
