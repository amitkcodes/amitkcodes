Projects
NTP Server Monitoring Script

Description: A Python script to monitor NTP servers (e.g., samay1.nic.in, 157.20.66.8) for synchronization accuracy. Logs offset data to CSV, sends alerts for 3 consecutive failures or high offsets (>0.01s), and supports rate-limiting and log rotation. Deployable via Docker for scalability.
Technologies: Python, ntplib, threading, logging, Docker, CSV
Features:
Monitors 16+ NTP servers with configurable intervals.
Alerts via email for critical failures, with rate-limiting to prevent spam.
Containerized for easy deployment.
